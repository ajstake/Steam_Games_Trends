# Early Findings

The earliest findings show that games that are multi-player or have multi-player not only have more players but also have a higher gross overall, as shown in figures 1 and 2. The most popular and highest grossing genres are Adventure, Action, and Roleplaying Games (RPG). The next steps are to examine average play time, the overall number of reviews (positive and negative), and the price each game is sold at relative to these factors.
