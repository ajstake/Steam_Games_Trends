# Exploring Steam Trends

The goal of this project is to increase the sales and profit of a video game by investigating several factors from other games on the platform Steam. After exploring the data through Google Sheets, some visualizations were constructed in Tableau to create a preliminary analysis for further exploration as a project pitch.

## Data Cleaning and Exploration

Data was cleaned and explored using Excel and Google sheets, with the data being found [here](https://github.com/ajstake/Steam_Games_Trends/blob/main/steam_trend_data.xlsx).

Findings were presented using google slides, with the presentation being found [here](https://github.com/ajstake/Steam_Games_Trends/blob/main/Steam_Games_Trends.pdf). Tableux was also used to create visualizations, with the workbook being found [here](https://github.com/ajstake/Steam_Games_Trends/blob/main/Steam_Trends.twbx).
