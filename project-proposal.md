# Project Proposal

I plan on examining data for video games released on the distribution platform of Steam to inform a game development company's next game creation to determine what game would garner the greatest success on Steam. This would examine details such as the types of games on steam with the highest overall positive reviews, the genre of game that fulfills, as well as the overall playtime to attempt to guide game creation in a way that is positively received and profitable.

## Data Used and MVP

The data gathered will be gathered from an agregation of freely available Steam game data from kaggle.com from May 2019. This data will be examining around 27,000 different games on Steam with their release dates, genres, reviews (both positive and negative), average playtime, median playtime, and the price the game was sold at. The **MVP** would look like a simple bar chart showing the top 10 most popular game genres on Steam as well as a chart showing the average distribution for playtime of each game. I plan on exploring this data using Google Spreadsheets and Tableau for visualizations of this data.
