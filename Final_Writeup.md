# Steam Game Trends and Pricing

Alex Stake

## Abstract

The goal of this project is to increase the sales and profit of a video game by ivestigating several factors from other games on the platform Steam. After exploring the data through Google Sheets, some visualizations were constructed in Tableau to create a preliminary analysis for further exploration as a project pitch.

## Design

This project aims to explore the best way to increase the sales of a video game by investigating the type (singleplayer or multiplayer), genres, and prices of games available on Steam, an online video game distribution platform. The preliminary impact hypothesis is that by focusing on making a game that either has or is multiplayer and is within one of the five most popular genres of game, it is likely that the price of the game can be increased which will in turn increase the profit of a game. 
The measures of success are in an increase in number of owners of the game as well as an increase in the overall gross of the game. The major assumptions with this data set is that the purchases made are at full price, the price of all games in the data are static from the time they were recorded, and that the game has no in game purchases that would increase its overall gross.

## Data

The data comes from ![Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nikdavis/steam-store-games?select=steam.csv) and contains the information for all steam titles released up until May 2019. Some features of this data include the title, release date, the genres it falls under, the type of game it is, the number of reviews (positive and negative), and the price the game is being sold at.

## Tools

 - Google Sheets for EDA and initial visualization
 - Tableau for further visualization
